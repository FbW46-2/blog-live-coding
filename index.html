            Velociraptor (/vɪˈlɒsɪræptər/; meaning "swift seizer" in Latin)[1]
            is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived
            approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the latter part of
            the Cretaceous Period.[2] Two species are currently recognized,
            although others have been assigned in the past. The type species is
            V. mongoliensis; fossils of this species have been discovered in
            Mongolia. A second species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for
            skull material from Inner Mongolia, China. ?

            Brontosaurus (/ˌbrɒntəˈsɔːrəs/[1][2]; meaning "thunder lizard" from
            Greek βροντή, brontē "thunder" and σαῦρος, sauros "lizard") is a
            genus of gigantic quadruped sauropod dinosaurs. Although the type
            species, B. excelsus, had long been considered a species of the
            closely related Apatosaurus,[3] researchers proposed in 2015 that
            Brontosaurus is a genus separate from Apatosaurus and that it
            contains three species: B. excelsus, B. yahnahpin, and B. parvus.[4]

          Tyrannosaurus[nb 1] is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur.
          The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin), often
          called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the most
          well-represented of the large theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived
          throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an
          island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider
          range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of
          rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper
          Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known
          member of the tyrannosaurids, and among the last non-avian dinosaurs
          to exist before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. ?
