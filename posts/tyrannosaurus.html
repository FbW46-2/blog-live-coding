    <h1>Tyrannosaurus</h1>
    <p>
      Tyrannosaurus[nb 1] is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur. The
      species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin), often called T.
      rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the most well-represented of the
      large theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North
      America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.
      Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils
      are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age
      of the upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the
      last known member of the tyrannosaurids, and among the last non-avian
      dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. .

      Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a
      massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and
      powerful hind limbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were short but unusually
      powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. The most complete
      specimen measures up to 12.3 meters (40 feet) in length though T. rex
      could grow to lengths of over 12.3 m (40 ft), up to 3.96 m (13 ft) tall at
      the hips, and according to most modern estimates 8.4 metric tons (9.3
      short tons) to 14 metric tons (15.4 short tons) in weight. Although other
      theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it is still among
      the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the
      strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest
      carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex
      predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, armored herbivores like ceratopsians
      and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the
      dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether Tyrannosaurus
      was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in
      paleontology. Most paleontologists today accept that Tyrannosaurus was
      both an active predator and a scavenger.
