    <h1>Velociraptor</h1>
    <p>
      Velociraptor (/vɪˈlɒsɪræptər/; meaning "swift seizer" in Latin)[1] is a
      genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 75 to 71
      million years ago during the latter part of the Cretaceous Period.[2] Two
      species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in
      the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis; fossils of this species
      have been discovered in Mongolia. A second species, V. osmolskae, was
      named in 2008 for skull material from Inner Mongolia, China.

      Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator,
      Velociraptor nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features. It
      was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged
      sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to
      tackle and disembowel prey. Velociraptor can be distinguished from other
      dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout.
