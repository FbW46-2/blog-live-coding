      Brontosaurus (/ˌbrɒntəˈsɔːrəs/[1][2]; meaning "thunder lizard" from Greek
      βροντή, brontē "thunder" and σαῦρος, sauros "lizard") is a genus of
      gigantic quadruped sauropod dinosaurs. Although the type species, B.
      excelsus, had long been considered a species of the closely related
      Apatosaurus,[3] researchers proposed in 2015 that Brontosaurus is a genus
      separate from Apatosaurus and that it contains three species: B. excelsus,
      B. yahnahpin, and B. parvus.[4]

      Brontosaurus had a long, thin neck and a small head adapted for a
      herbivorous lifestyle, a bulky, heavy torso, and a long, whip-like tail.
      The various species lived during the Late Jurassic epoch, in the Morrison
      Formation of what is now North America, and were extinct by the end of the
      Jurassic.[5] Adult individuals of Brontosaurus are estimated to have
      weighed up to 15 tonnes (17 short tons) and measured up to 22 metres (72
      feet) long. As the archetypal sauropod, Brontosaurus is one of the
      best-known dinosaurs and has been featured in film, advertising, and
      postage stamps, as well as many other types of media.
